# A-Heuristics-to-Solve-TSP

Implementation of A* algorithm using Uniform Cost(UCS), Random Remaining Edge(RRE), and Cheapest Remaining Edge(CRE) heuristics.

For this exploration, we will use a symmetric ajecency matrix as the problem definition for the TSP.

The Uniform Cost Search heuristic is where every state has cost 0 for the heuristic and only compares by the path taken to current state position.
